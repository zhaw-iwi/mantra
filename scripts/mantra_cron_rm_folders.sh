# Script to remove too old MantraId project folders
#===
#
# This script removes folders in /tmp/projects that were created
# more than X seconds ago.
#
# Codeboard's Mantra runs this script as a CRON job every
# few minutes to make sure we don't have many old project
# folders hanging around.
#
# Run this script: ./mantra_cron_rm_folders.sh 30 /tmp/projects
# (i.e.: delete folders in /tmp/projects that were created more than 30 min ago)
#
# Important: Mantra itself as a "maxLifetimeForMantraId" parameter. If a mantraId is
# older than that value, Mantra will automatically create a fresh MantraId. This script
# can thus safely delete folders that are older than "maxLifetimeForMantraId".
# So make sure to set the value for this script accordingly.
