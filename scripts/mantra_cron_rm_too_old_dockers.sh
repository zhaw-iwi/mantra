# Script to remove too old Docker containers
#===
#
# This script removes all containers that were created
# more than X seconds ago.
#
# Codeboard's Mantra runs this script as a CRON job every
# few minutes to make sure we don't have any containers
# hanging around that e.g. were created but not started.
#
# Run this script: ./mantra_cron_rm_too_old_dockers.sh 1200
# (1200 means: delete containers created more than 1200 sec ago)
#
